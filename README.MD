#UT-DataBC-Project-1

Welcome to our groups project on BEES! I hope you find our project informative!

Please view the powerpoint in the main directory to view the main project! bee_powerpoint

The following directories were used to create and manipulate different datasets to come up with our project:
/Colony_and_Pest_Dataset
/Honey_Sales_and_Production
/Pesticide_Data
/Temperature_Bee

/Colony_and_Pest_Dataset
includes ColoniesPy which allows the user to pull data from USDA and request state. This request then creates a line graph outlining the colony data for bees in that state.
includes PestsPy which allows the user to pull data from USDA and request state. This request then creates a line graph outlining Varroa Mite affecting Bee colonies based on the state selected.
Images generated by above scripts are saved in the Output directory.

/Honey_Sales_and_Production
includes honey_production_and_sales_final which allows the user to graph production and sales for the US and Texas based on CSV pull from USDA.
Images generated by above scripts are saved in output_images directory.

/Pesticide_Data
includes Pesticides which graphs data based on certain pesticides found and used in honey.
Images generated by above scripts are saved in output_images directory.

/Temperature_Bee
This is the Temperature data for Texas. This can be located in Weather_Texas.ipynb file. I took the information from api_pull.ipynb to compare bees to temperature. 

In the output_images folder, you can find the graphs that have been generated based off of Weather_Texas.ipynb. 

Please use Weather_Texas.ipynb as the main file for this section of Bee Project.
